My CSS snippets for the notetaking app [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).

To use: 
1. Download any .css file you want from above
2. Be sure you can view hidden files in your file browser
3. Open your vault location in your file browser and go to the folder `.obsidian`
4. Go to the folder `snippets` (inside the `.obsidian` folder)
5. Place the .css file you downloaded into the `snippets` folder
